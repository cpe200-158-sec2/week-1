## Read and understand the code, the logic behind it, the limitation of it
* Answer the question 1 - 4 below (you can edit this file directly)
* Change the code such that it will sort from larger to smaller, put the revision of your code below
* Change the code such that there is no flag variable, put the commit number below and answer question 5 


## Revision, put your commit number here
* Sort from larger to smaller: a9ad789a7aca4ff5a47a06d8ca4253de99109e55
